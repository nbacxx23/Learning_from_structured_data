DESCRIPTION
=======================================================================

This BaseNP Chunker takes English text that has been part-of-speech
tagged by Eric Brill's transformational tagger and tries to insert
brackets marking the contained baseNP structures, using heuristic
transformational rules trained on Wall Street Journal text from the
UPenn Treebank.  For more information about baseNP structures and the
use of tranformation-based learning to derive them, see "Text Chunking
Using Transformation-Based Learning", Lance Ramshaw & Mitchell Marcus,
Proceedings of the Third ACL Workshop on Very Large Corpora, MIT,
June, 1995 (http://xxx.lanl.gov/e-print/cmp-lg/9505040), or contact the
authors:
  Lance Ramshaw <ramshaw@polar.bowdoin.edu>
  Mitchell Marcus <mitch@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

This version applies a fixed set of 500 baseNP rules trained on WSJ
text.  (The training material was the contents of directories wsj_15,
wsj_16, wsj_17, and wsj_18 from the merged files in Penn's Treebank
2.)  If your goal is to learn transformational rules to identify
baseNP structures in different sorts of text, or to identify different
kinds of structures, contact the authors.

ACCESS
=======================================================================

The BaseNP Chunker is available by anonymous ftp from the machine
  ftp.cis.upenn.edu 
as the file 
  /pub/chunker/basenp_chunker_1/chunker.tar.gz
Transfer this file in binary mode, and then unpack it with
  gunzip -c chunker.tar.gz | tar xvf -

Please send a note to <ramshaw@polar.bowdoin.edu> if you download the
system, so that we can keep you informed of any changes.


=======================================================================
INSTALLATION
=======================================================================

The BaseNP Chunker is implemented in C++ and Perl.  To install it:

1) In the code directory, check that the CC variable in the Makefile
correctly identifies your local implementation of C++, and then run
make.

2) Back in the basenp_chunker_1 directory, check that the first line
of chunker.pl points to your local version of Perl.  If not, change it,
and similarly change the first line of each of the five Perl scripts
in the perl directory.

3) Set the variable $chunk_dir at the top of chunker.pl to the full
pathname of the basenp_chunker_1 directory that was created when you
unpacked the tar file.

4) In the basenp_chunker_1 directory, if you now say
    chunker.pl sample_input > test_output
the system should create a new test_output file identical to the
sample_output file provided.

5) If other people than you are going to run the code, you should turn
on world write permission for the tmp subdirectory.
